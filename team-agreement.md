# Team Agreement:

1.	Communication plan:
 * We will communicate with each other through Zoom, Slack, and, at camps if possible and necessary.
 * Our communication includes sketches, visuals, or, any means necessary to communicate ideas correctly.
 * We take turns in exchanging ideas.
 * Every idea is written down and each member is given enough time to explain his ideas then other members can make comments or add to it. (Group brainstorming)
 * We take a vote before any decision is made.
 * After each step, we give time for feedback, concerns, and objections.
 * No idea is a bad idea, everything that a member suggests is impressive, we just have to choose the best for the team within the time provided.
 * There is no judgment nor blaming. Every member is essential to the team and a crucial part of its success.

2.	Conflict plan:
 * Discussion and listening are our way to go.
 * First, we will try to understand the cause and the source of the conflict.
 * Try to list the possible solution depending on the type of conflict.
 * Keeping in mind that our main goal is to gain experience in teamwork and make a successful project, so nothing should be taken personal.

4.	Git process:
 * Everyone in the team will have access to the project's repo.
